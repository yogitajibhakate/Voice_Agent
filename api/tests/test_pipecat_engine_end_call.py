"""Tests for verifying end_call_with_reason behavior in different scenarios.

This module tests the end call flow in PipecatEngine with multiple scenarios:
1. Normal end call when transitioning to end node
2. End call triggered by custom end_call tool
3. End call triggered by on_client_disconnected
4. Race condition between end_call tool and client disconnect

For all scenarios, we verify:
- Pipeline muting (_mute_pipeline is set to True)
- Variable extraction is called (_perform_variable_extraction_if_needed)
- Call disposition flag is set (_call_disposed is True)
- User audio muting via CallbackUserMuteStrategy (should_mute_user returns True)

The tests use MockTransport with audio generation to simulate real pipeline scenarios
where InputAudioRawFrame frames are continuously generated. The pipeline includes
LLMUserAggregatorParams with user mute strategies (MuteUntilFirstBotCompleteUserMuteStrategy
and CallbackUserMuteStrategy) matching the production run_pipeline.py configuration.
