"""Tests for TTS pause_frame_processing with audio write failure scenarios.

This module tests a scenario where:
1. TTS service has pause_frame_processing=True
2. Output transport's write_audio_frame returns False (simulating failure)
3. TTS pauses frame processing while generating audio
4. Audio write failures occur but BotStoppedSpeakingFrame is never sent
5. TTS remains paused indefinitely
6. end_call_with_reason is called and hangs because EndFrame can't be processed

The root cause is that when write_audio_frame fails consecutively in _audio_task_handler,
it breaks out of the loop without calling _bot_stopped_speaking(), leaving the TTS
in a paused state that blocks all subsequent frame processing including EndFrame.

Two test scenarios are covered:
1. Bot started speaking, then audio write fails (fail_after_n_frames > 0)
   - BotStartedSpeakingFrame is emitted
   - Some audio is written successfully
   - Write starts failing, _audio_task_handler breaks out
   - _bot_stopped_speaking() is NOT called (the bug)
   - TTS remains paused

2. Bot never started speaking because write failed immediately (fail_after_n_frames = 0)
   - Audio write fails from the first frame
   - _bot_currently_speaking() is called but write fails
   - _audio_task_handler breaks out after consecutive failures
   - _bot_stopped_speaking() is NOT called (the bug)
   - TTS remains paused
