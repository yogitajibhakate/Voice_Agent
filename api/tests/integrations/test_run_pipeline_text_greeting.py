"""Integration test for the text-greeting flow through ``_run_pipeline``.

Drives the full pipeline produced by ``_run_pipeline`` against the test
database with a workflow whose start node has a text greeting configured.
The flow under test:

1. ``maybe_trigger_initial_response`` (in ``event_handlers.py``) sees a
   text greeting and queues ``TTSSpeakFrame(greeting)``.
2. ``MockTTSService`` synthesises audio for the greeting; the real
   ``MediaSender`` machinery in ``MockOutputTransport`` emits
   ``BotStartedSpeakingFrame`` and ``BotStoppedSpeakingFrame``.
3. The TTS service emits an ``LLMAssistantPushAggregationFrame`` after
   ``TTSStoppedFrame``, so the greeting is appended to the assistant
   context by ``LLMAssistantAggregator``.
4. We then push a ``TranscriptionFrame`` into the pipeline. After the
   user-turn-stop timeout, ``LLMUserAggregator`` pushes a context frame
   to the LLM, ``MockLLMService`` returns an ``end_call`` tool call, and
   the engine's transition function moves to the end node and calls
   ``end_call_with_reason``.
5. ``on_pipeline_finished`` records the run as COMPLETED.

External boundaries are patched via ``patch_run_pipeline_externals``
from the shared helpers module. Preconfigured ``MockLLMService`` /
``MockTTSService`` instances are passed in so the end_call response is
deterministic and the synthesised audio length is short.
