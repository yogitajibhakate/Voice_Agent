"""Integration tests for ``api.services.pipecat.run_pipeline._run_pipeline``.

Drives the actual ``_run_pipeline`` against the test database with real
DB rows (organization, user, user configuration, workflow, workflow run)
and pipecat's real ``MockTransport`` / ``Pipeline`` / ``PipelineWorker``.
The only patches are for things that talk to genuinely external systems;
those are applied via ``patch_run_pipeline_externals`` from the shared
helpers module.

Verifies that the wiring done by ``_run_pipeline`` (in particular
``register_event_handlers``) produces the right behaviour end-to-end:
``maybe_trigger_initial_response`` fires (``engine.set_node`` runs), and
on shutdown the workflow run is persisted with the expected state,
completion flag, and ``gathered_context`` entries.
