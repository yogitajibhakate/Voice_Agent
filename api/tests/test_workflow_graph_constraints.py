"""Regression tests for WorkflowGraph edge/graph constraints + the
rule-based audit that mirrors them.

Each fixture in `dto_fixtures/` is either a clean workflow or a single
category of violation we found in production. We pin two layers:

  1. WorkflowGraph — semantic gate used by `/publish`, the SDK API, and
     both MCP tools. Driven by `NodeSpec.graph_constraints`. If this
     layer ever stops rejecting one of these fixtures, the production
     write paths will quietly start accepting bad workflows again.
  2. audit_definition (api.services.workflow.audit) — read-only sweep
     over persisted rows for one-off cleanup tooling that finds
     legacy/imported breakage. Pinned so refactors of the rule set
     don't silently change those cleanup verdicts.

DTO-level shape validation is covered by `test_dto.py` and isn't
re-pinned here.
