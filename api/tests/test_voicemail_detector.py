"""Tests for understanding voicemail detector behavior with user aggregator and LLM.

This module tests the interaction between the voicemail detector, user aggregator,
and LLM in a pipeline. It demonstrates how the voicemail detector classifies
incoming speech as CONVERSATION or VOICEMAIL and how the main LLM responds.
