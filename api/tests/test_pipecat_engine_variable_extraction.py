"""Tests for verifying variable extraction is triggered for the correct node during transitions.

This module tests that when the LLM calls a node transition function, variable extraction
is performed for the SOURCE node (where the conversation happened), not the TARGET node.

The key behavior being tested:
1. LLM calls a transition function (e.g., "collect_info") from START node
2. START node has extraction_enabled=True with extraction_variables
3. AGENT node (target) has extraction_enabled=False
4. Variable extraction should be triggered for START node's variables
5. Variable extraction should NOT be triggered for AGENT node
