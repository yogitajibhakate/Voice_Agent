    Realtime services (e.g. OpenAI Realtime, Gemini Live) handle STT+LLM+TTS
    internally, so no separate STT or TTS processors are needed.

    Args:
        voicemail_detector: Optional VoicemailDetector. Placed *below* the
            realtime LLM. This is asymmetric with the non-realtime layout
            (where the detector sits between STT and the main user aggregator)
            because the realtime LLM is both the source of TranscriptionFrame
            (broadcast downstream) and the sink of LLMContextFrame (consumed
            by _handle_context without forwarding). Placing the detector below
            the realtime LLM means: downstream TranscriptionFrames reach the
            classifier branch, UserStartedSpeakingFrame /
            UserStoppedSpeakingFrame are forwarded through by the LLM, and the
            main aggregator's LLMContextFrame is absorbed by the realtime LLM
            and never leaks into the classifier (which would otherwise run a
            voicemail completion on the workflow's main context).

            The TTS gate and LLM gate are intentionally not used: the realtime
            LLM reacts to audio directly, not to LLMContextFrames. On voicemail
            detection we drop the call via end_call_with_reason; the detector's
            ConversationGate also blocks downstream audio output until the call
            ends.
