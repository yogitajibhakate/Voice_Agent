"""Factory for creating telephony providers.

Resolves a provider instance from a stored telephony configuration. Three
resolution paths exist:

* by config id — the canonical path used by outbound (test calls, campaigns,
  API triggers) and by the websocket transport once a workflow run has
  ``initial_context.telephony_configuration_id`` stamped on it.
* by org default — used as a fallback when no specific config is requested.
* for inbound — given a detected provider and an account-id from the webhook,
  iterate the org's configs of that provider and return the one whose stored
  account-id credential matches.

Provider classes don't need to know about the new storage shape. They still
receive a normalized config dict containing credentials plus a
``from_numbers`` list of address strings, which the factory assembles by
joining ``telephony_phone_numbers``.
