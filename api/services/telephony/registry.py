"""Provider registry for telephony.

Each provider package registers itself by importing this module and calling
``register(ProviderSpec(...))`` from its ``__init__.py``. Consumers (factory,
audio config, run_pipeline, schemas) look up providers through ``get(name)``
or iterate via ``all_specs()`` instead of branching on provider name.

Adding a new provider should not require any edit outside its own folder
plus a single import line in ``providers/__init__.py``.

        provider_cls: The TelephonyProvider subclass.
        config_loader: Normalizes raw stored config into the dict shape the
            provider constructor expects. Replaces the old factory if/elif
            chain.
        transport_factory: Async callable that creates the pipecat transport
            for an accepted WebSocket. Provider-specific kwargs (stream_sid,
            call_sid, etc.) are forwarded as ``**kwargs``.
        transport_sample_rate: Wire-format audio sample rate this provider
            uses (e.g. 8000 for Twilio/Plivo, 16000 for Vonage). The pipecat
            layer derives the full ``AudioConfig`` from this.
        config_request_cls: Pydantic model for incoming save requests.

            UI to render a provider-specific form. Surfaced via
            ``GET /api/v1/telephony/providers/metadata``.

    NOT carried on the spec. They live in

    ``api.routes.telephony`` via ``importlib`` so route handlers (which
    can have deep dependency chains into campaign/db code) don't get
