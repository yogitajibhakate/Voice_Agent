    Public HTTP endpoints that launch the workflow.  LLM hint: Exposes two
    public HTTP POST endpoints derived from the auto-generated
    `trigger_path`:   • Production:
    `<backend>/api/v1/public/agent/<trigger_path>` — runs the published
    agent. Use this from production systems.   • Test:
    `<backend>/api/v1/public/agent/test/<trigger_path>` — runs the latest
    draft, useful for verifying changes before publishing. Falls back to the
    published agent when no draft exists. Both require an API key in the
    `X-API-Key` header. Request body fields:   • `phone_number` (string,
    required) — destination to dial.   • `initial_context` (object,
    optional) — merged into the run's initial context.   •
    `telephony_configuration_id` (int, optional) — pick a specific telephony
    configuration for the call. Must belong to the same organization as the
    trigger. When omitted, the org's default outbound configuration is used.
