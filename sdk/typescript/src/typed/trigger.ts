 * Public HTTP endpoints that launch the workflow.
 *
 * LLM hint: Exposes two public HTTP POST endpoints derived from the auto-generated `trigger_path`:
 *   • Production: `<backend>/api/v1/public/agent/<trigger_path>` — runs the published agent. Use this from production systems.
 *   • Test: `<backend>/api/v1/public/agent/test/<trigger_path>` — runs the latest draft, useful for verifying changes before publishing. Falls back to the published agent when no draft exists.
 * Both require an API key in the `X-API-Key` header.
 * Request body fields:
 *   • `phone_number` (string, required) — destination to dial.
 *   • `initial_context` (object, optional) — merged into the run's initial context.
 *   • `telephony_configuration_id` (int, optional) — pick a specific telephony configuration for the call. Must belong to the same organization as the trigger. When omitted, the org's default outbound configuration is used.
